    <div class="leftparagraph">
      El Niño Southern Oscillation, aka ENSO, is a cycle of warm (El Niño) and 
      cool (La Niña) weather events that occur every few years in the equatorial Pacific Ocean.
  </div>

  <div class="rightparagraph">
      In California, an El Niño event results in unusally wet weather in traditionally dry Southern California, and unusually dry weather in 
      traditionally wet Northern California. However, it has global impacts, vastly altering climates from North America, to Southeast Asia, and all the way to South Africa.
  </div>
  
  <div class="leftparagraph">
      The El Niño cycle "...is the most dramatic year-to-year variation of the Earth’s climate system, affecting agriculture, public health, 
      freshwater availability, power generation, and economic activity in the United States and around the globe."
  </div>

  <div class="rightparagraph">
      The impact of human induced climate change will increase the extremes, on both ends, of future El Niño and La Niña events.
